# Quadratic Interpolation Optimization Method (MATLAB)
An easy to understand implementation of the aforementioned method. 
We use a second order polynomial to approximate a given function.
The code prints out the optimal value and the number of iterations it took the algorithm to calculate it.
Written for a class I'm enrolled in: "Optimal Control".
